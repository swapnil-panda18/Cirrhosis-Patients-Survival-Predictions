# Cirrhosis-Patients-Survival-Predictions
Build a predictive model which help in predicting the Status of the patient using Machine learning algorithms.
Carried out Data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and applied Feature Engineering techniques like (Handling missing values, encoding categorical features and target feature, handing outliers).Utilized ML algorithms and  applied Hyperparameter tuning to above best 3 models Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Xgboost for overcome overfitting and getting better accuracy.
